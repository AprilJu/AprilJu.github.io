The model lives within our clientâ€™s GPU server which acts as the machine where we
perform training. The data preprocessing pipeline will transform the NIST2020 and
GNPS datasets through four stages: graph creation, graph splitting, dimensionality
reduction, and feature engineering. The output of this pipeline is a graph structure
compatible with GNN training models and methods. Finally, the product provides a
training pipeline to train and evaluate the performance of the GNN model.

    The data pipeline is responsible for taking in a dataset of molecules (including their
structural and MS/MS data) and doing a series of transformations on this data to
create a graph. This figure describes the data filtering and processing processes applied.
