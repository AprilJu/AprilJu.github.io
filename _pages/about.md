I am a recent Computer Engineering graduate from the University of British Columbia with distinction, with a strong research interest in robotics locomotion and intelligent control. My work spans Human-inspired (Bipedal) Locomotion and the development of an auto Inverse Kinematics solver for 6R robotic arms, integrating machine learning, optimization, and computational kinematics. These experiences have solidified my interest in two complementary paradigms of Artificial Intelligence: cognitive and decision-making intelligence, and behavioral intelligence at the mechatronic level. I aspire to leverage these paradigms to design lighter, more precise, dexterous, and energy-efficient bionic robotic arms.
