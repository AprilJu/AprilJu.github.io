I'm Yiran (April) Ju, a Computer Engineering student at the University of British Columbia with a minor in Commerce, set to graduate in May 2024. My journey includes being a Research Assistant at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, where I developed a high-precision equation-solving system and a multifunctional robotic joint. I've also served as a Teaching Assistant at UBC and as an R&D Intern at Nanjing Panda Electronics, enhancing my skills in software development and system design.
